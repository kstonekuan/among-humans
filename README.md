# AI-Assisted Interrogation Room

**A Real-Time Multiplayer Social Deduction Game built for an AI Gaming Hackathon.**

---

## Overview

AI-Assisted Interrogation Room is a web-based multiplayer game where human players interact in a chat-like environment to identify a hidden AI player ("Synth") among them. Players submit text answers to creative prompts each round. What makes it unique:

1.  **Personalized AI Assistants:** Each human player receives private hints from their *own* AI assistant, which analyzes all submitted answers for suspicious patterns.
2.  **Dynamic AI Player:** The AI opponent ("Synth") generates its answers using an LLM, gets a "vibe-based" name generated by an LLM to blend in, and votes strategically based on heuristics.
3.  **The Twist:** While the main goal is to catch Synth, human players can *also* win rounds by successfully deceiving others into voting for *them* as the AI!

Can you trust your AI assistant? Can you outsmart the AI player? Or can you fool everyone into thinking *you're* the machine?

## Gameplay Loop

1.  **Join:** Players connect via their browser and enter a name.
2.  **AI Activation & Naming:** The server activates the AI player ("Synth"). An LLM generates a name for Synth designed to stylistically fit in with the human players' names.
3.  **Prompt:** A text-based prompt appears for all players (e.g., "Describe your perfect Sunday in 10 seconds").
4.  **Answering:** Humans type and submit answers within a time limit. Simultaneously, the server uses an LLM to generate Synth's answer.
5.  **AI Assistant Analysis:** After time's up, each human player's *private* AI assistant analyzes all submitted answers (human + Synth) via an LLM call.
6.  **Information Reveal:** Players see:
    *   Their own **private hint** from their AI assistant.
    *   **All public answers** submitted by players (including Synth).
7.  **Voting:** Players vote for who they suspect is the AI player. Synth also casts a vote strategically near the end of the voting period.
8.  **Results & Scoring:** Votes are tallied.
    *   **AI Caught?** If Synth receives the most votes, humans who voted correctly score points (+2).
    *   **Human Deception?** If a single human receives the most votes, that human scores points (+3) for successful deception, *and* Synth scores (+1) for surviving.
    *   **AI Survives (Other):** In other cases (e.g., tie among humans), Synth scores (+1) for surviving.
9.  **New Round:** The game proceeds to the next round with a new prompt.

## Key Features

*   **Real-Time Multiplayer:** Uses Socket.IO for seamless interaction between players.
*   **Dynamic AI Player ("Synth"):**
    *   **LLM-Generated Answers:** Provides contextually relevant (or cleverly evasive) answers.
    *   **LLM "Vibe-Based" Naming:** Attempts to blend in from the start with a generated name.
    *   **Strategic Voting:** Employs simple heuristics (e.g., pile-on majority, target outlier) to influence the vote.
*   **Personalized AI Assistants:** Each human player gets unique, private hints generated by an LLM analyzing the round's text data.
*   **Dual-Goal Social Deduction:** Balances the objective of finding the AI with the possibility of winning through deception.
*   **Chat-Based Interaction:** Gameplay revolves around creative text input and analysis.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
*   **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS 4.x, TypeScript
*   **AI:** Anthropic Claude API
*   **Environment Variables:** `dotenv`

## Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create Environment File:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the project root.
4.  **Add API Key:**
    Add your LLM API key to the `.env` file. Use the correct variable name based on the SDK used:
    ```dotenv
    # Example for Anthropic:
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

    # Example for OpenAI:
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
    *   **Important:** Ensure the `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing your secret key!
5.  **Ensure `.gitignore`:** Verify that `.env` and `node_modules/` are listed in your `.gitignore` file.

## Running the Project

1.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
3.  **Access the game:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in `server.js`).
3.  **Simulate Multiple Players:** Open multiple browser tabs or windows pointing to the same address. Each tab will act as a separate player.

## Hackathon Context

This project was developed under the time constraints of an AI gaming hackathon. As such, it is a prototype demonstrating the core concepts.
*   The UI is functional but minimal.
*   Error handling might be basic.
*   Advanced AI strategies (for Synth voting or assistant hints) are simplified.
*   Focus was placed on integrating the multiple AI features into the real-time game loop.

## Potential Future Ideas

*   More sophisticated AI voting strategies.
*   Allowing players to customize their AI assistant's focus.
*   Persistent player scores across sessions.
*   Improved UI/UX and visual feedback.
*   Wider variety of game prompts.
*   More robust error handling and API fallback mechanisms.
