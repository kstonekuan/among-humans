- Prefer typescript over javascript
- Prefer tailwind css (version 4.x)
- Always run builds and linting after making changes and fix the errors
- Prefer biome over eslint
- Make incremental changes instead of huge ones
- Seek out good opportunities for unit testing and implement them
- You can run build, lint, and format commands but do not run the server itself
- Prefer accurate and descriptive function names over writing comments, even if they are verbose
- Do not leave behind legacy code and comments
- Important note about Tailwind CSS 4.x: If styling issues occur, check the generated tailwind.css file for missing classes. Tailwind 4.x requires using the 'safelist' option in tailwind.config.js to include dynamically used classes. The project uses a custom.css file to supplement missing classes.
